# Data Science Tutorials
This repository contains the tutorials to learn the EDA of the dataset. 

## 1st tutorial 
This is about data impututation.
I replicated this totorial from the [KdNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2022/07/scikitlearn-imputer.html)

I used the SKlearn Imputer. 
  SKLearn has imputer for numeric as well as categorical data columns. 
  
 
 At the end of the tutorial we used a pipoeline for the data transformation. This pipeline can have multiple transformation step and the last one is only fit step for the transformation. 

We also used KNNN wiuth neighbors 2 to fill in the missing data for numerical columns in the data. 


Next Tutorials are coming up.
